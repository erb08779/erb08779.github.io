At the University of Georgia, I wanted to find ways I could spend my freetime. Tuesday's
and Thursday's I work at a clothing store called <b>Dress Up</b>. It's a women's boutique shoppers can
get current styles for an affordable price. I also joined a business fraternity named <b>Pi Sigma Epislon</b>. 
This organization specializes in helping marketing, sales and management students find employment 
post-graduation and helps them to build professionalism.Through this organization I've met many friends and gotten
contacts for potential jobs. In the fall, I joined <b>HEROs</b>. This club is centered around helping children affected
amd infected by HIV/AIDS. We were able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to support these kids.</p>
<p>Finally,my favorite organization I have become involved with is my sorority, <b>Gamma Phi Beta</b>. The photo to the right is from our webasit I am a member of the 
Delta Upsilon chapter of Gamma Phi Beta at the University of Georgia and through this organization I 
am able to be surrounded by women who harbor the same values I do. Addtionally, my sorority is involved with 
the philanthropy, <b>Girls on the Run</b>, in order to support and build strong girls.</p>
